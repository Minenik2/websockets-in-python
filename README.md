# websockets in python

Simple websocket communication using the websockets library found here: https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
pip install websockets
this is to learn for a uni project

https://apmonitor.com/dde/index.php/Main/WebSocketTransfer

the first files are client.py and server.py
they use the socket library to communicate with each other about the user input of their name

in the buzzer folder, we are trying to have communication between the server and two clients, the client that presses the buzzer first will say that they were first, and the second client will recieve how many seconds after he pressed the button.

you can have as many client as you want
